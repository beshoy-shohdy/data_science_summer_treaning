# 🎬 Movie Data Analysis — Summer Training Project

## 📋 Overview
This project was developed during a **Data Science Summer Training** program.  
It focuses on **data cleaning and machine learning modeling** using multiple movie-related datasets.  
The goal is to explore patterns, build predictive models, and perform unsupervised clustering on movie data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Combine multiple datasets related to movies, genres, companies, countries, and languages  
- Perform data preprocessing and handle missing values  
- Apply regression models to predict movie-related metrics  
- Use clustering to uncover hidden groupings or patterns  

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML algorithms and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- **Linear Regression:** Predicts numeric outcomes based on movie features.  
- **Decision Tree Regressor:** Captures nonlinear relationships in the data.  
- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups movies with similar characteristics.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **R² Score**

## 🔍 Insights
The project explores relationships between:
- Production companies and movie performance  
- Genres and audience reception  
- Country and language influences on movie success  

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Cleaning and merging multi-source data  
- Applying regression and clustering models  
- Evaluating performance with standard ML metrics  
- Visualizing relationships and patterns effectively
